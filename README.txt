===========================================================================

If the program does not run, most likely you are missing these:

Windows Requirements: 

- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) 2 (!)Required
- Intel Fortran Compiler suite

Linux Requirements:

- Use pyinstaller to compile a Linux executable or contact Navin Solomon.
- gfortran

===========================================================================

NOTICE: The GUI only works up to the stage 1 tab right now!
Please read the console output when running the program
Use stagen-18.1.exe and plotall-17.1.exe to create plots. Built in plotting in the future? Probably not.
